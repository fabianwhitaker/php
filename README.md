webapps
=======

Code files of different utilities that can be used for web applications. Combined, these construct a simple PHP-MySQL social networking site. 

These files were created in my free time at the age of 14, and are as such outdated as of December 2021. 
I now code mainly in Python and R as part of my degree in Mathematics at the University of St. Andrews (grad: 2022).
